## Data Processing
In this part, we decided to build a machine learning model to help the new Airbnb hosts set their price. 
The first step is handling outliers, we examined the price distribution, filtered the outliers, as well as removed the  NA value of potential features. The final dataset contains 26624 observations.    
![data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liziqun/MUSA620_Final_Project/master/assets/images/hist_price.png)
``` python
airbnb_gpd = airbnb_gpd [(np.log1p(airbnb_gpd ['price']) < 8) & (np.log1p(airbnb_gpd ['price']) >3)]
airbnb_gpd=airbnb_gpd.dropna()
len(airbnb_gpd)
```
> 26624   
  
## Price Spatial Distribution of New York airbnb
