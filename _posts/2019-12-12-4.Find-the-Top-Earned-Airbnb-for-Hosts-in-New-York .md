### Calculation of Potential Monthly Yield of Airbnb
According to According to Airbnb's [official statistics](https://blog.atairbnb.com/economic-impact-airbnb/), in New York, the Airbnb visitors stay on average 6.4 nights. Besides, a review rate of [50%](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) was chosen to convert reviews to estimated bookings based on the past experience of Airbnb company. Based on the above data, we could infer the Airbnb host's monthly revenue, the calculation formula is as follows:

> <p align="center"> yield_per_month = Average length of stay * price * (number of reviews per mouth /review rate) </p>

```python
# calculate the average monthly yield
airbnb["yield"]=airbnb["price"]*airbnb["reviews_per_month"]*6.4*2
```

### Secrets behind the Yield Differences (hvplot)  
After calculating the monthly yields of Airbnb listings, we classify the results into 3 categorys: high yield(top 30%), median yield(30%-70%), low yield(70%-100%), in order to find the reasons for yield diffrences.

Firstly, we compared the `host_year` among different yield types. A interesting finding is that the new hosts' Airbnb seem to earned more than those experienced hosts.
