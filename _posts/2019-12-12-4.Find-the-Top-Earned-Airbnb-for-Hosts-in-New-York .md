### Calculation of Potential Monthly Yield of Airbnb
According to Airbnb's [official statistics](https://blog.atairbnb.com/economic-impact-airbnb/), in New York, the Airbnb visitors stay on average 6.4 nights. Besides, a review rate of [50%](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) was chosen to convert reviews to estimated bookings based on the past experience of Airbnb company. According to the above statistics, we were able to infer the Airbnb host's monthly revenue, the calculation formula is as follows:

> <p align="center"> yield_per_month = Average length of stay * price * (number of reviews per mouth /review rate) </p>

```python
# calculate the average monthly yield
airbnb["yield"]=airbnb["price"]*airbnb["reviews_per_month"]*6.4*2
```

### Reasons behind the Yield Differences (hvplot)  
After calculating the monthly yields of Airbnb listings, we classified the results into 3 categorys: high yield(top 30%), median yield(30%-70%), low yield(70%-100%).In this part, we decided to do some simple comparison among different yields' Airbnb.

To begin with, we compared the `host_year` among different yield types. A interesting finding is that the new hosts' Airbnb seems to earned more than those experienced hosts.  
<div id="hv-chart-1"></div>   
  
     
In terms of the host response time, the high-yield Airbnb host's response time is much higher than the median-yield hosts and low-yields hosts, most of them response to the guests within an hour.    
<div id="hv-chart-2"></div>  
    
    
Besides, the percentage of high-yield hosts who verified their identity is higher than those who do not. However, in the low-yield group, the reverse seems to be happening.      
<div id="hv-chart-3"></div>  
   
     
When it comes to the `instant_bookable`, it could be inferred from the following figure that whether the Airbnb is intant bookable might have no effect on Airbnb yields.

### Secrets of the Top 5000 yield Airbnb in NY (altair)
Here, we chose the Top 5000 yields Airbnbs to further explore their characteristics. Firstly, we visualized the spatial distribution of those high-yield Airbnb. 
<div id="folium-chart-1"></div>    
  
Obviously, those high-yield Airbnbs are still located in in Manhattan and brooklyn.
<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>    
  
Also, we explored the price ditribution of high-yield Airbnb by room type. The result indicates that most of the Airbnb in New York is Entire home, and the price of entire home is also generally higher than the private room.($50-$300 for entire apt, $50-$150 for private room).

How about the cancellation policy? we explored the relationship between cancellation policy of high-yield Airbnb and their room types, and found that most of the high-yield Airbnb have a strict cancellation period (with a grace period of 14 days).
<div id="altair-chart-2"></div>  

Are review scores positively related with Airbnb yield? The answer seems to be *yes*!  
<div id="altair-chart-4"></div>  

Then, we analysis the texts of high-yield Airbnbs' names and found the top 15 common words.

A wordcoud is also been created. These words can be divided into groups, each reflecting different characteristics about Airbnb:  
- the first group contains popular room types, like apt, studio and loft; 
- the second group is about locations, like manhattan, brooklyn,and williamsburg; 
- the third category may suggest some popular characteristics, such as cozy,luxury and private;

### Recommendations for Airbnb Hosts
Therefore, to conclude the analysis there are several points that low-performer could do to increase their probability to get more bookings, reviews, and higher number of reviews;

Increase the acceptance rate of the rental. Top performer almost never reject the orders, not like low performers around 45% of the listings that did not accept any bookings. Although we do not know the reason why the hosts did not accept the orders;

- Be responsive most of the top performer hosts always giving response within an hour about 80% of all the time.
- Be a superhost. Itâ€™s the status and the recognition from the Airbnb because they provide amazing experience and great example for other hosts.
- Always response the conversations. More responsive the hosts, more better the score it would be. Top performers always response to every conversation.
- Activate the instant bookable features; They give better experience to the future guests.
- Make your account verified by Airbnb. Many of low performer accounts have not verified by Airbnb more than the high performer by 25%.

Future development plan: This new comprehensive recommendations feature, could be attached in every page of User Interface that have Informations about those variables, notifications, or other forms of reminders to the eligible hosts. Hosts that subscribe this feature could be charge in reasonable price.!
