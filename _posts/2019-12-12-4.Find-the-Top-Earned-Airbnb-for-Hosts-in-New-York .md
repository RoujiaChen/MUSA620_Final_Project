### Calculation of Potential Monthly Yield of Airbnb
According to According to Airbnb's [official statistics](https://blog.atairbnb.com/economic-impact-airbnb/), in New York, the Airbnb visitors stay on average 6.4 nights. Besides, a review rate of [50%](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) was chosen to convert reviews to estimated bookings based on the past experience of Airbnb company. Based on the above data, we could infer the Airbnb host's monthly revenue, the calculation formula is as follows:

> <p align="center"> yield_per_month = Average length of stay * price * (number of reviews per mouth /review rate) </p>

```python
# calculate the average monthly yield
airbnb["yield"]=airbnb["price"]*airbnb["reviews_per_month"]*6.4*2
```

### Secrets behind the Yield Differences (hvplot)  
After calculating the monthly yields of Airbnb listings, we classified the results into 3 categorys: high yield(top 30%), median yield(30%-70%), low yield(70%-100%), in order to find the reasons for yield diffrences.

To begin with, we compared the `host_year` among different yield types. A interesting finding is that the new hosts' Airbnb seem to earned more than those experienced hosts.

In terms of the host response time, the high-yield Airbnb host's response time is much higher than the median-yield hosts and low-yields hosts, most of them response to the guests wighin an hour.

Besides, the percentage of high-yield host who verified their identity is higher than those who do not. However, in the low-yield group, the reverse seems to be happening.

When it comes to the `instant_bookable`, it could be inferred from the following figure that whether the Airbnb is intant bookable seems to have no effect on Airbnb yields.
