<font size=2> **Airbnb** is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. For Airbnb hosts, this is a potentially lucrative option for their under-utilised vacation homes, spare rooms or even beds. However, Airbnb still has some unmet needs:On one hand, it is difficult for new hosts to ascertain whether the Airbnb will be a worthy investment and how their property could earn more. On the other hand, for the Airbnb company, encouraging hosts gain more potential revenue might also helping expand market share.

This project aims to set up a series of mechanism to help Airbnb company meet the needs of users,which could not only served as a guidance for the Airbnb hosts to raise more potential revenue, but also could be used as a guidance for guests when booking an Airbnb.Most importantly ,this mechanism  could be adopted as an additional function that provided by Airbnb company for those premium users, in order to create more benefits for the enterprise. 

Generally, this project would be devided into 4 parts:
- Explorary Analysis of New York Airbnb
- Find the Most Cost-Effective Neighbourhood for Guests in New York 
- Find the Top-Earned Airbnb for Hosts in New York 
- Pricing Tip Prediction for New Hosts in New York
