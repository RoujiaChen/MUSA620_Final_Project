### Data 
We loaded the Airbnb Listing data (from [InsideAirbnb][InsideAirbnb]) and cleaned the original dataset. To be more specific, we removed data that do not contain location information,transformed datatype of certain fields(e.g. `price`,`host_response_rate)`, and added new field (`price_per_person`=price/accommodates) into our Airbnb dataset. Also, we loaded New York neighborhood data (from [NYC OpenData][NYC OpenData]), which served as a spatial reference for further analysis.

### Spatial  distribution of New York Airbnb  (folium)
In the very first beginning,we visualize the spatial distribution for the New York Airbnb listings. At first sightï¼Œ most of the Airbnb  are located in Manhattan and brooklyn.

Then, we calculated the airbnb count by neighborhood and did spatial join with the Newyork neighborhood data, as can be seen from the following results, the brooklyn seems to have more Airbnb than Manhattan, especially in williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant.

In terms of the average price by neighbourhood group, the Manhattan and Brooklin is much higher than Queens, Staten Island and Bronx, which explains why there are more Airbnbs in these two areas.

We also explored the relationship between `host_year` (the year that host opened the Airbnb) and the count of different room types of Airbnb.Both of the entire home and private room seems to have a absolute big market share,while an interesting finding is that the private room seems to have become a more popular chioce than the entire home for Airbnb host since 2015.
