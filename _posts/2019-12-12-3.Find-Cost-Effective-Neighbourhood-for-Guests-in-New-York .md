### Cluster Analysis
In this part, we clustered neiborhoods by Airbnb stats, trying to find desirable neighbourhoods for the Airbnb guests. Firstly, we selected the `price_per_person`,`reviews_per_month`,`review_scores_rating` and `count` as our variables, and calculated mean value of thoses variables by neighbourhood. Secondly, a K-means cluster analysis is performed and the results are devided into 5 labels, the results map is as follows:

<div id="altair-chart-1"></div>

For each features, we could calculater the average value per cluster:
```python
group_cluster.groupby('label')['price_per_person'].mean().sort_values()
```
> label  
> 0    31.247056  
> 4    33.483703  
> 1    37.457584  
> 2    53.109358  
> 3    80.434985  
> Name: price_per_person, dtype: float64  

```python
group_cluster.groupby('label')['review_scores_rating'].mean().sort_values()
```
> label  
> 4    91.364327  
> 2    93.701058  
> 3    94.164047  
> 0    94.923690  
> 1    95.913784  
> Name: review_scores_rating, dtype: float64

```python
group_cluster.groupby('label')['reviews_per_month'].mean().sort_values()
```
> label  
> 3    1.120334  
> 1    1.267650  
> 2    1.274230  
> 4    1.660396  
> 0    2.890525  
> Name: reviews_per_month, dtype: float64  

```python
group_cluster.groupby('label')['count'].mean().sort_values()
```
> label  
> 0      37.510638  
> 4      81.396226  
> 1     106.000000  
> 3     251.360000  
> 2    1938.222222  
> Name: count, dtype: float64  

### Potential Airbnb guests classification

Based on the clustering results, we try to divide our potential Airbnb guests into several categories, and recommended different neighborhood for each, respectively.
