**Airbnb**  is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. For Airbnb hosts, this is a potentially lucrative option for their under-utilised vacation homes, spare rooms or even beds. However, Airbnb still has some unmet needs.On one hand, it is difficult for new hosts to ascertain whether the Airbnb will be a worthy investment and how their property could earn more. On the other hand, for those potential Airbnb guests, more specific advice on choosing a living place might increase the likelihood that people opt for Airbnb when traveling.  

Thus,this project aims to set up a series of mechanism to help Airbnb hosts get higher profits, which could not only served as a guidance for the Airbnb hosts to earn more, but also can be used as an additional function that provided by Airbnb company for those premium users, in order to create more benefits for enterprise.
