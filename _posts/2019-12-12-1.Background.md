**Airbnb** is a platform that enables people to find short to longer-term accommodation. As part of the hospitality network, it doesn't own any of the lodgings displayed on their website or app. It rather acts as a digital marketplace where people looking for a place to stay (guests) can rent an accommodation from an owner (host). For Airbnb host, it is a potentially lucrative option to share their under-utilised vacation homes, spare rooms or even beds. For Airbnb guest,it's also a great opportunity to visit a city with first-hand insights,since most of Airbnb hosts love to share their experiences and recommend their favorite places

Although Airbnb has brought many convenience for people, it is still necessary for us to focus on potential demands for both Airbnb hosts and guests. On one hand,  it is difficult for new hosts to ascertain whether the Airbnb will be a worthy investment and how their property could earn more. On the other hand, for those potential Airbnb guests, more specific advice on choosing a staying place might increase their satisfaction with Airbnb.  

This project aims to set up a series of mechanism to satisfy the needs of Airbnb users, which could not only served as a guidance for both the Airbnb hosts and guests, but also can be used as an additional function that provided by Airbnb company for those premium users, in order to create more benefits for enterprise.
